BACKTRACKING:
CSP --> problems divided in:
        * variables
        * domain
        * restrictions

Solving CSP as a search problem:
    * state --> starting ex: blank {}
            --> goal --> all vars enumerated {A: 5, ..., Z: 101}
    * transitions --> applying value to a variable
    * algorithim --> seen previosly
